This is a Many To-Do Lists app: A To-Do List app with multiple lists.

On the left side of the split screen, the user can create a TodoList.
By tapping on a TodoList, the TodoItems that belong to the TodoList are shown on the right.

Both a TodoList and a TodoItem can be removed by swiping the TodoList/TodoItem to the left tapping 'Delete'.
A completed TodoItem can be marked by tapping 'Check'. 
(This can be undone in the same way and by tapping 'Uncheck'.)
